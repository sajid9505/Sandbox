## Pedro The Racoon

### Project Overview

This is a NextJS-based website dedicated to the recent "Pedro" meme that has been taking the internet by storm. The site was inspired by an Instagram user who created a similar page, and I decided to follow suit and create my own version.

### Technologies Used

- **NextJS**: A popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and other advanced features, providing a robust foundation for the website.
- **Vercel**: The hosting platform used to deploy the site, ensuring fast and reliable performance.
- **Material UI**: A popular React-based UI library that provides a wide range of UI components and design elements, allowing for the creation of a modern and responsive user interface
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core web technologies used to build the site's structure, styling, and interactivity.

### Deployment

The site is currently deployed on Vercel, which provides a seamless hosting experience for NextJS applications. You can visit the live site at [Pedro - The meme](https://pedro-smoky.vercel.app/).
